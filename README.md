## 🐞 **Troubleshooting**

Here are some common problems and how to solve them:

### 1. **Python Version Issues**  
Make sure you're running **Python 3**! You can check your version with:
```bash
python --version
```
(For Mac/Linux, use `python3 --version`.)

If you're using Python 2.x, you may need to install Python 3 or use `python3` in the terminal.

### 2. **Missing Dependencies (ModuleNotFoundError)**  
This game uses only **built-in Python libraries**, so you don’t need to install any external dependencies. If you encounter a `ModuleNotFoundError`, ensure Python is properly installed.

### 3. **Game Not Starting**  
If running `python main.py` doesn’t work:
- **Check your directory**: Make sure you’re in the correct project folder.
  ```bash
  ls
  ```
- You should see `main.py` in the directory. If not, you’re not in the right place.

### 4. **Incorrect Input During Gameplay**  
If you encounter issues with your input, remember:
- Use **capital letters** when needed (e.g., “**Move**” instead of "move").
- The correct actions in battle are: `Attack`, `Heal`, or `Run`.
- To navigate: Type `Move` to explore new areas or `Inventory` to check your items.

### 5. **Changing Game Code**  
If you’ve modified the code and things go haywire:
- **Check for syntax errors**, such as missing parentheses, colons, or misspelled variable names.
- Try **reverting** recent changes and testing the game again.
